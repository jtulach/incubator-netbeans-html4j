    <h2>What is this?</h2>

    <p>
    This is a rewrite of React.js <a target="_blank" href="https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html">Tic Tac Toe tutorial</a> 
    controlled by application written in JavaFX Light and
    <a target="_blank" href="http://github.com/jtulach/bck2brwsr">transpiled to JavaScript</a>.
    </p>

    <h2>Action</h2>
    <p>
    Click on any square to change its state to <b>X</b>. However this time
    the <code>Square</code> notifies the <code>Board</code> of an <code>onClick</code>
    event and let's the <code>Board</code> change its <code>BoardState</code>
    (with <code>List&lt;Character&gt;</code> and identification of next player)
    and re-render the whole board.
